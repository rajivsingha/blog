Hey everyone!

## I still haven't figured out what to write yet so "hello world" seemed like the way to go

BTW, this site was built using a SSG because I had almost no intentions of setting up Wordpress.

My first choice was Ghost. Love it's editor to the moon and back!

Unfortunately, setting up Ghost was a bit more complicated than I could handle and although Digital Ocean had a pretty straightforward 1 click install process, I still managed to run into issues.

This one uses [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and is pretty simple to set up with Netlify. #myfirstexternallink

So far it feels nice but let's see how it goes once I add more posts to the site.

That's all for now.

Do stick around :)
